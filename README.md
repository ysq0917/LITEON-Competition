AI computer vision appearance defect detection
------------------------------------------------
<br>
PCBA (Printed Circuit Board Assembly) is the installation of circuit components on a printed circuit board (PCB). In order to ensure the production quality of PCBA, it is traditionally required to conduct optical image inspection before leaving the factory. The captured image is used to pass Image comparison method or design rule inspection method is used for defect detection. However, different brands and models of inspection machines will have obvious differences in image resolution and image color gradation. This proposition hopes to use a small number of defective image vision to establish an accurate AI model and have the opportunity to apply to PCBA inspection on different machines. To quickly screen out defective products and enhance the market competitiveness of high-reliability products.

Participating teams are required to propose AI detection models based on the following requirements. After registration is completed, training and verification data sets can be downloaded from the download point in the backend. Please integrate the AI ​​model into an exe executable file. The program outputs the inference results of each photo (file name) in .txt format. Please compress the exe into a .zip file format and upload it to the designated website for model accuracy verification. The preliminary selection criterion is the accuracy of the AI ​​detection model. During the submission period, the accuracy ranking will be published regularly for reference by each team. The top 10 finalists will be announced immediately after the submission deadline. The shortlisted teams are required to submit project reports, technical descriptions and testable AI models for verification.

## Selection criteria

<br>
The AI ​​image detection model was trained using a total of 12,000 labeled images of eight categories from machine A and a total of 200 labeled images of eight categories from machine B.
The accuracy of the B machine model reaches over 95%.
The recall rate of defective images from machine B is over 90%.
The organizer will regularly announce the accuracy and recall verification results of each team from the opening of registration to one month before the closing of registration (final selection) for the team's reference.

<br>
Select the top 10 groups based on the model accuracy index (if the accuracy is the same, select the team that reaches the accuracy in the shortest time)
